# UniMatrix

Python script to simulate the display from "The Matrix" in terminal. Uses half-width katakana unicode characters by default, but can use custom character sets. Accepts keyboard controls while running.

Based on CMatrix by Chris Allegretta and Abishek V. Ashok. The following option should produce virtually the same output as CMatrix:
```
$ unimatrix -n -s 96 -l o
```
## Install

Linux users can use curl to install:
```
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/will8211/unimatrix/master/unimatrix.py -o /usr/local/bin/unimatrix
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/unimatrix
```
If you do not have curl, you can alternatively use a recent wget:
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/will8211/unimatrix/master/unimatrix.py -O /usr/local/bin/unimatrix
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/unimatrix
```
You can also install it with pip:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/will8211/unimatrix.git
```

Users of Arch-based distros can get it from the AUR as ```unimatrix-git```, although it might not be the most recent version.
